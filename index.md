#Data Visualization

##Data Wrangling for plots A and B.
```{r}
#Select desired variables from Tobacco.
Tobacco_Measure <- Tobacco %>%
  select(Year, State, MeasureDesc, AgeRange)

#Adding a measure descriptor variable and selecting desired variables from Heart.
Heart_Measure <- Heart %>%
  add_column(MeasureDesc = "Heart Disease") %>%
  select(Year, State, MeasureDesc, AgeRange)
  
#Bind the two datasets together.
TobaccoHeart <- rbind(Tobacco_Measure, Heart_Measure)
```

```{r}
#Calculating percentages
#We did this so that our graphs aren't taken over by the large sample size of the Heart data set. If we don't use percentages, it would look like there were more individuals with heart disease in each state relative to their number of smokers. But in reality, the large number would just be because of the bigger sample. 

TobaccoHeartTable <- TobaccoHeart %>%
  #Count the number of unique rows.
  count(Year, State, MeasureDesc, AgeRange) %>%
  #Split momentarily into Tobacco and Heart again.
  group_by(MeasureDesc) %>%
  #Find the percentage of each unique "grouping" within each original dataset.
  mutate(Frequency = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  #Split into Tobacco and Heart but this time also split by state.
  group_by(MeasureDesc, State) %>%
  #Find the percentage of each grouping relative to the state it belongs to in the original dataset.
  mutate(FrequencyByState = n / sum(n))
```

###(A) Plot A uses both data sets.
```{r}
#Plot shows the count of people who currenlty smoke and have died from heart disease by age groups across Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington.
ggplot(TobaccoHeartTable, aes(x = MeasureDesc, y = n, fill = MeasureDesc)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ AgeRange, ncol = 3) +
  ggtitle("Number of people who currently smoke or have died from heart disease by age") +
  labs(fill = "Condition") +
  xlab("Condition") +
  ylab("Count of people")
